### Hi there 👋

I am a Doctoral Researcher at the Centre for Human Brain Health (Birmingham, UK) working in the field of neuroimaging. I am interested in computer programming, health data science and data visualisation. At the moment, I am working in the field of Disorders of Consciousness (such as vegetative state or coma), and I am studying new possible therapeutic approaches using techniques as MRI, EEG and non-invasive brain stimulation. 

🔭 I’m currently investigating the relationship between connectivity changes in the brain following brain stimulation, and electric field characteristics.
