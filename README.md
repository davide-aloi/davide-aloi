### Hi there 👋

I am a Health Data Scientist at Lifebit, focusing on developing and optimising medical data engineering pipelines (using Nextflow, Python, Bash, R, AWS) and on clinical data standardisation with the OMOP Common Data Model, FHIR and medical ontologies (SNOMED, ICD10, etc).

My PhD projects involved both healthy and clinical data (functional MRI, structural MRI, EEG, clinical scales).


## Last PhD project:
- I investigated the relationship between connectivity changes in the brain following brain stimulation (tDCS), and electric field characteristics as estimated by MRI-derived models ([repository](https://github.com/Davi93/wp1_2_roast)).
